# To-Do-List-

This will contain our To-Do List Project for Software Engineering.


The user would input a series or list of tasks they want to complete. Menu will show options such as adding, deleting, and editing the tasks. Once the user inputs a task, the page will show the task that has been added. Otherwise, the task stays or gets deleted if the user decides to remove it.
